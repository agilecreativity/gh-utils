Clojure library designed to automate some useful git command without the need to
use the web browser. Based on the [tentacles][] library with sensible default.
You can simply create new Github repo with one simple command and one config file.
TL;DR; `gh-utils --config ./Dropbox/private/config.edn --repo my-awesome-idea`

### Installation and usage as command line interface (CLI)

#### Installation

```sh
# Clone this repository locally
mkdir -p ~/projects

git clone https://github.com/agilecreativity/gh-utils.git ~/projects/gh-utils

cd ~/projects/gh-utils

# Create the `~/bin` folder to hold the executable
mkdir -p ~/bin

# Generate the standalone using `lein bin`
lein bin
```

#### Usage

You will need to create the simple [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) configuration
file. The file can have any name but the format must be something like:

```clj
{:username "YOUR-GITHUB-ID"
 :password "YOUR-GITHUB-PASSWORD"}
```

- To create a repository called `my-awesome-idea` (private by default) try

```sh
# The long version
gh-utils --config config.edn --repo my-awesome-idea

# Or shorter version
gh-utils -c config.edn -r my-awesome-idea
```

- If you already inside the root directory of the project and the file `config.edn` is
in already in the same directory that you are running this command then

```sh
mkdir -p ~/codes/my-awesome-idea
cd ~/codes/my-awesome-idea

# Just run the command without any argument
gh-utils
```

Now open `https//github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ID/my-awesome-idea` in your browser.

### Development

### Roadmaps & TODOs

- [ ] Add the intial commit with README.md file `touch README.md && git add README.md && git commit -m "Add README.md" && git push"`
- [ ] Allow override of default options like ':public', ':description', etc
